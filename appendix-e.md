The data dictionary contains descriptions of the data available through the various MIDAS endpoints. It also contains the complete information from the various lookup tables available through MIDAS. Please note that the lookup tables may not be perfectly aligned with what is in MIDAS if CEC staff have made changes to the lookup tables on the MIDAS server. The authoritative lookup tables are those available through the MIDAS API.
