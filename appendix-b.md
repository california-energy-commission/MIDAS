## Glossary

**Application Programming Interface (API)**: is an intermediary that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. <br>
**California Energy Commission (CEC)**: is the state of California’s primary energy policy and planning agency. <br>
**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: is a classification of cyber attacks aimed at making a website unavailable to actual users of the product. <br>
**Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)**: is a gas that absorbs and emits radiative energy, contributing the climate change. <br>
**Global Unique Identifier (GUID)**: is a unique set of characters used to identify records in the MIDAS database. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier> for more information. <br>
**Independent System Operator (ISO)**: oversees the operation of California's electric power system, transmission lines, and electricity market generated and transmitted by its member utilities. <br>
**A Load Serving Entity (LSE)**: provides electricity to customers (load) directly through purchases of electric energy. <br>
**Market Informed Demand Automation Server (MIDAS)**: is the CEC’s centralized, publicly accessible, rate, greenhouse gas emissions, and FlexAlert database. <br>
**Representational State Transfer (RESTful) API**: An API that follows the guidelines of REST architectural style to interact with other RESTful services. <br>
**Rate Identification Number (RIN)**: is the primary lookup ID for electricity rates in the MIDAS system. <br>
**Time Dependent Rate**: is a rate where one or more of the cost components changes intra-day. For an electricity customer, this means that the price of electricity depends on the time of day. <br>
**Time-of-Use (TOU)**: rates refer to electricity prices that are based on the times at which they are demanded and consumed. TOU rates usually have two to three different prices at different times of day. The time pattern and the prices are set months or years ahead. See <https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-rates> for some more information on TOU rates in California. <br>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: the primary standard time used to regulate clocks and time worldwide. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time> for more information.
