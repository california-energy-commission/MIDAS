## Glossary

**Application Programming Interface (API)**: An intermediary that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. <br>
**California Energy Commission (CEC)**: The state of California’s primary energy policy and planning agency. <br>
**California Public Utilities Commission (CEC)**: The state of California’s public utility regulator. <br>
**Distrubution Company**: Term used in MIDAS. The company responsible for electricity delivery to electricity users. <br>
**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: A classification of cyber attacks aimed at making a website unavailable to actual users of the product. <br>
**Energy Company**: Term used in MIDAS. The company responsible for procuring the electricity for electricity users. An energy company is usually also an LSE. <br>
**Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)**: A gas that absorbs and emits radiative energy, contributing the climate change. <br>
**Global Unique Identifier (GUID)**: A unique set of characters used to identify records in the MIDAS database. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier> for more information. <br>
**Independent System Operator (ISO)**: Oversees the operation of an electric power system, transmission lines, and electricity market generated and transmitted by its member utilities to manage market and maintain electric system reliability. The largest ISO in California is the [California Independent System Operator](http://www.caiso.com/about/Pages/default.aspx). <br>
**Load Serving Entity (LSE)**: Any company that sells or provides electricity to end users located in California. For this document, that means the companies uploading their rate information to MIDAS for users to access. <br>
**Market Informed Demand Automation Server (MIDAS)**: The CEC’s centralized, publicly accessible database of elecreicity rates, greenhouse gas emissions, and FlexAlerts. <br>
**Representational State Transfer (RESTful) API**: An API that follows the guidelines of REST architectural style. The Wikipedia page on [representational state stranfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) has further details. <br>
**Rate Identification Number (RIN)**: The identification number used for looking up electricity rates in the MIDAS system. <br>
**Time Dependent Rate**: A rate where one or more of the cost components changes intra-day. For an electricity customer, this means that the price of electricity depends on the time of day. <br>
**Time-of-Use (TOU)**: Electricity rates that vary based on the the time of day. TOU rates usually have two to three different prices at different times of day. The time pattern and the prices are set months or years ahead. See <https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-rates> for some more information on TOU rates in California. <br>
**Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**: The primary standard time used to regulate clocks and time worldwide. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time> for more information.
