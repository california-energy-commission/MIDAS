# Appendix A - Uploading to MIDAS

Only CEC approved entities can upload to MIDAS. After establishing a MIDAS account by registering through the `registration` API endpoint and verifying your email by clicking on the link, request upload capabilities by sending an email to midas@energy.ca.gov from your LSE email account. CEC staff will review your request and respond.

Note: Utilities may be assigned either distribution or energy company access to MIDAS. These assignments change what rates the user is allowed to upload. For now, LSE accounts will be assigned as energy companies, but this may change depending on ongoing discussions.

## Rate and Holiday Upload Support

LSEs are encouraged to reach out to CEC staff at midas@energy.ca.gov with any questions or issues with MIDAS. Staff will do their best to answer any questions and address issues quickly.

The rate upload XML schema is available through the MIDAS API. The version from the API is the canonical one. However, we are also providing the XML schema document as part of this documentation. [XML Schema Document](support-docs/MIDAS-upload-XML-schema.xsd).


## Rate Definitions

MIDAS is designed to provide energy users with the electricity price information they need to decide when to use energy. While it would be useful for electricity users to be able to use the data from MIDAS to try to estimate electricity bill totals, some current billing structures such as tiered rates make this impossible without private customer-specific data. Electricity users need information (prices) on the volumetric portions of their rates to effectively optimize energy use. This tells them how much each kWh costs during a particular time period. Energy users can use this information to decide when to use electricity. They can also set their controllable devices to adjust when they use electricity based on the same information. When enough users shift their electricity use to cheaper and greener hours when more renewable energy is available, this can reduce electricity costs for all users of the grid.

## Upload Rates

Rates must be updated in MIDAS before prices change so that electricity users can plan for and act on price changes. LSEs can upload rates to MIDAS in either XML or JSON format.

### Rate Examples

Here are some example rate upload documents to help LSEs format rate uploads. Each example XML or JSON file only contains a few days worth of data (March 1-3, 2023) for readability. 

* **TOU rate** An example of a TOU rate with hourly values. A full year of this rate would have 8760 ValueData blocks<br>
[XML TOU example](support-docs/MIDAS_Test_TOU.xml)<br>
[JSON TOU example](support-docs/MIDAS_Test_TOU.json)
* **TOU rate with time-varying demand charges** This file contains the same rate as the TOU file, but also contains ValueData blocks for time-dependent demand charges<br>
[XML TOU+demand example](support-docs/MIDAS_Test_Demand.xml)<br>
[JSON TOU+demand example](support-docs/MIDAS_Test_Demand.json)

### Assigning a RIN

The first step to uploading a rate to MIDAS is to determine the Rate Identification Number (RIN). See [Figure 1](README.md#database-structure) for the RIN structure. If a rate already exists in MIDAS and you don't have the RIN available, refer to the [Get RIN LIST](README.md#get-rin-list) section in the main docuemntation to download the list of RINs, and make sure to use the existing RIN. If the rate has never been previously uploaded to MIDAS, you will need to determine the RIN before uploading.

For California-based LSEs, the first four characters of the RIN will always be **USCA**, showing that the LSE is in the United States (US) and California (CA). For utility users in other countries and states/provinces, refer to the **Country** and **State** lookup tables to find your country and state code.

The next step is to determine the distribution and energy company codes that make up the next four characters of the RIN. Refer to the **Distribution** and **Energy** lookup tables to find the two character codes that correspond to your distribution and energy companies. For example, Marin Clean Energy would use the Pacific Gas and Electric distribution company code **PG** and the Marin Clean Energy energy code **MC**, yielding **PGMC** for the second four characters.

The next four characters are open for the LSE to define. These four alphanumeric characters (containing only uppercase English letters and the numeric digits 0-9) should, to the extent possible, reflect the rate. For example, a commercial TOU rate could have the four characters **CTOU**, or a critical-peak rate could have the characters **CPP2**.

The final four to 10 characters are the location code. For rates with no specific location, use the four character code **0000**. The list of allowable location codes are available in the **Location** lookup table. If your LSE has location codes to add to that table, contact the MIDAS team at midas@energy.ca.gov to request the addition of those codes.

Putting this together for a full example, the full RIN for a rate at Marin Clean Energy could be **USCA-PGMC-CTOU-0000**.

### Rate Upload Data Structure

The canonical requirements for the rate upload structure is the XML rate upload schema available through the API at the `/ValueData` endpoint. You can use this schema verify that your rate upload is structured correctly prior to uploading to MIDAS using XML validation software.

**Endpoint:** `/ValueData`

**HTTP Request:** `POST https://midasapi.energy.ca.gov/api/ValueData`

**Authorization:** Bearer

**Query Parameters:** None

**Body Parameters:** None

**Python Example**

```python
import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

headers = {'accept': 'application/json', 'Authorization': "Bearer " + token}
url = 'https://midasapi.energy.ca.gov/api/valuedata'
pricing_response = requests.get(url, headers = headers)

element = ET.XML(json.loads(pricing_response.text))
ET.indent(element)
print(ET.tostring(element, encoding='unicode'))
```

#### Streaming Rate Structure
All rates uploaded to MIDAS should be in a "streaming" structure. This is a time-series structure where every hour (or sub-hourly period) has an entry. There needs to be at least one value for every hour, if the rate changes with a frequency higher than hourly, it needs to have one entry for each period where the rate could change, even when it does not change.

If the rate has more than one value in each interval each value will have the fields shown in the next paragraph. For example, a rate with asymmetric prices where the import price is different from the expost price will need to have the following fields for each hour for the import price using the unit "\$/kWh" and also the following fields for the export price with the unit "export \$/kWh".

Each time period (interval) contains these fields:
* **DateStart** _required_ This is the date in UTC when the rate interval starts.
* **TimeStart** _required_ This is the time in UTC when the rate interval starts.
* **DateEnd** _required_ This is the date in UTC when the rate interval ends.
* **TimeEnd** _required_ This is the time in UTC when the rate interval ends.
* **DayStart** _required_ This is the day type (1-8) when the rate interval starts. Allowable day types are in the DayType lookup table.
* **DayEnd** _required_ This is the day type (1-8) when the rate interval ends. Allowable day types are in the DayType lookup table.
* **Value** _required_ This is the value (usually the price) that applies to the interval.
* **Unit** _required_ This is the unit that applies to the Value (usually $/kWh) that applies to the interval. Allowable units are in the Unit lookup table.
* **ValueName** _required_ A description that applies to the interval.

The `DateStart` and `TimeStart`, and `DateEnd` and `TimeEnd` fields in the rate must be in UTC. Combining `DateStart` and `TimeStart` will yield a UTC datetime, as will combining `DateEnd` and `TimeEnd`. For example, for the first hour of March 1 in California (UTC-8), we would convert an interval start date of "2023-01-01" and start time of "00:00:00" to UTC, yielding a `DateStart` of "2023-01-01" and `TimeStart` of "08:00:00".

One day of a streaming rate would include the information Table 1. The table shows data for March 1, 2023 in the "America/Los_Angeles", also known as "PST/PDT" time zone. Note that the dates and times are all in UTC:

* **RatePlan_Url** _optional_ A valid URL that directs to the utility webpage describing the rate plan
* **RateType** _optional_ The applicable rate type; must be one of those in the RateType lookup table
* **Sector** _optional_ The sector that the rate applies to; must be one of those in the Sector lookup table
* **EndUse** _optional_ The end use that the rate applies to; must be one of those in the EndUse lookup table
* **API_Url** _optional_ A valid uniform resource locator (URL) that specifies the API that provides the values

### POST Rate Information

_This function is available to authorized LSE accounts only._ <br>
Populating the RateInfo and Value tables requires a call to the ValueData endpoint. Upload data may be encoded in XML or JSON. Acceptable data entries are catalogued in supporting MIDAS lookup tables listed in the Appendix. At the time the rate data is uploaded, it is also added to the HistoricalData table. For mor information, see [Archiving Data to HistoricalData](README.md#archived-data-in-the-historicaldata-table) in the main documentation. Each RIN may only store a total of 50,000 values in the Value table.

**Endpoint:** `/ValueData`

**HTTP Request:** `POST https://midasapi.energy.ca.gov/api/ValueData`

**Authorization:** Bearer

**Query Parameters:** None

**Response:** A successful upload will return an HTMLStatusCode of 200

**Python Example**

```python
import os 
import sys
import requests

# File on the local filesystem that is correctly formatted against the XML schema definition (XSD) or analagously formatted JSON.
priceFileName = 'XML_streaming_upload.xml'

headers = {'accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'text/xml', 'Authorization': "Bearer " + token}
url = 'https://midasapi.energy.ca.gov/api/valuedata'
priceFile = open(priceFileName)
xml = priceFile.read()
priceFile.close()
pricing_response = requests.post(url, data = xml, headers = headers)

print(pricing_response.text)
```

## Upload Holidays

Uploading the list of holidays for your LSE should only need to happen on occasion, perhaps once per year. These holidays will apply to all rates for your LSE.

### Example Holiday Upload Files

Here are example files for holiday uploads, one using JSON and the other using XML. MIDAS will accept either format, but you must change the Content-Type header accordingly. For JSON, the content type should be "text/json" or "application/json" and for XML, it should be "text/xml" or "application/xml".

[JSON Holiday example](support-docs/MIDAS_Test_Holidays.json)

[XML Holiday example](support-docs/MIDAS_Test_Holidays.xml)

### POST Holiday Values

_This function is available to authorized LSE accounts only._ <br>
LSEs can upload the holidays that apply to their rates. This supports MIDAS users by making it clear which days are holidays on the rates they download. Populate the Holiday table by POSTing to the Holiday endpoint. The XML schema document is available as part of this documentation at [Holiday Upload XML Schema](support-docs/MIDAS-Holiday-XML-schema.xsd.xml).

**Endpoint:** `/Holiday`

**HTTP Request:** <br> `POST https://midasapi.energy.ca.gov/api/Holiday`

**Authorization:** Bearer

**Query Parameters:** None

**Body Parameters:**

When uploading to the Holiday table, the body of the uploaded XML or JSON has the following fields for each holiday:

| Name                              | Description                                              | Example | Type |
